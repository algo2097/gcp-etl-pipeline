# gcp-etl-pipeline

This project implements an end-to-end ETL pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to process Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) vehicle sales and options datasets. The pipeline ingests raw CSVs into a data lake, transforms them into structured BigQuery tables, applies data quality checks, and enriches the sales data with profit calculations.
